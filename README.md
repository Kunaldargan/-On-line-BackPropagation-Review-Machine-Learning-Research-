SUMMARIZATION BY KUNAL DARGAN:

Aim of the paper is to establish the fact that Deep Artificial Neural Networks works in complete harmony with on-line Back propagation to yield a very low error rate on the famous MNIST handwritten digits Benchmark and can be of great commercial use and have varied implementation into fields ranging from banking, postal services etc. where better sorting and identification of human handwriting is a tedious task and labor can be reduced significantly.  
On- line BP is the improved form of Back propogation algorithm which get optimised quickly .As computing power has grown significantly so even 1.12 million nodes in Deep net of which they have created 5 samples get solved quickly by making use of GPU accelerated online- BP which adjusts learning rate after every transition.As already data was 60K images still to make the pool of training and testing can be infinitely increased by creating variation in images by implementing various factors to transform images it makes Model more stable .
